# Delos Video Viewer
A handy HTML video viewer for Delos that lets you conveniently set the speed as you watch.

# What is this ?

Delos (https://delos.uoa.gr/) is an online service that provides video content from serveral Greek universities.
A lot of these videos are saved lectures that you can watch later even if you were not present in class.
This generally is very handy because you can watch the lectures any time you want.

What Delos' video viewer lacks unfortunately is the ability to set the video speed. That would
be extremely useful because you can save so much time by watching in higher speeds most of the
time and only decreasing the speed when a difficult topic is discussed.

With this one-file utility, you can use your favorite browser, grab the video URL from Delos, paste it
and watch the video while also being able to control the speed in real-time.

# Usage

You can access it online here: http://users.uoa.gr/~sdi1600105/delos-video-viewer/

## Offline usage
Open the file `viewer.html` in your favorite browser. Then, you can grab the link of any video URL
in Delos and paste it into the big textbox. Click set video and you can
then watch it while also setting the speed with the + and - buttons.

Note: To grab the URL, you click into the specific title of the video. That sends you in a page
that for every video says "Resource Details" in the title (i.e. in the tab). You want to grab the
URL of this page.
